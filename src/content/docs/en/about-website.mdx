import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This website is built and maintained free of charge by uft@obiscr.com and others, primarily to collect Xiangqian Zhang's Unified Field Theory and many other works. Everyone can watch for free.

**Our fundamental principle is to retain the original content of the works without any deletions or modifications.**

However, to help readers better understand, we will add some important annotations, proofread formulas, correct minor errors, and include animations and illustrations. All parts we add will be displayed in a style similar to the one below: (Apart from this, all other content comes from Zhang Xiangqian's works)

<Aside title="Annotation">
  The content here is added by the website maintainers and not from Zhang Xiangqian's original works. If you have any questions or find errors, you can directly contact the corresponding contributor using the email at the bottom right of the annotation.
