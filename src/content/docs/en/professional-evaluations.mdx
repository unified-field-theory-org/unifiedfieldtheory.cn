</Card>

*Zhang XiangQian's Unified Field Theory* was officially published in the
United States on January 2, 2025, with international distribution and
formal inclusion in the Library of Congress. Related works on this
groundbreaking theory are now available for purchase on Amazon and other
global sales platforms.

As the translator, editor, and author of the popular science edition of
Zhang XiangQian’s Unified Field Theory, I hope to use this publication
opportunity to share my understanding of Mr. Zhang’s theory and the journey
of creating the various versions of these books.

Currently, I am a Senior IT Security Analyst for the Office of the Clerk of the 
U.S. Congress. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from Peking 
University, a Bachelor's degree in Divinity, and a Master's degree in 
Information Science. I am a certified CISSP (Certified Information Systems
Security Professional) and CCSP (Certified Cloud Security Professional) and
have passed the Nuclear Medicine Technologist certification exam.
Additionally, I have been invited multiple times as a distinguished expert
to participate in CISSP and CCSP exam question development workshops, and
also make significant contributions to the Chinese-language exam content.

These achievements highlight my rigorous academic approach and professional
expertise. I hope to assure readers that my statements are well-founded and
not made lightly, avoiding any views that could compromise my credibility.

I firmly believe that Zhang XiangQian’s Unified Field Theory has the
potential to profoundly impact human civilization, possibly surpassing
Einstein’s theory of relativity.
